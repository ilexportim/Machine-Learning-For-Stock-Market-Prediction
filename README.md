Machine Learning For Stock Market Prediction

This project is an analysis of the performance of machine learning techniques and conventional statistical models in predicting stock market trends. The analysis focuses on both linear and non-linear regression models applied to the historical stock market data of five major companies: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google.

The dataset used in this analysis is titled "FAANG-Complete Stock Data," and it is available on Kaggle. The project was conducted by OULBACHA Ilyas, a master's student in IT/Data Science at Leeds Beckett University.

The project contains six experiments, each presented in a Google Colab notebook. The results and discussions of the experiments are presented in a PDF document. Additionally, the project contains an article summarizing the findings of the research, as well as a detailed dissertation report.

This project seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of machine learning techniques and conventional statistical models in predicting stock market trends. The results of this study will be useful for individuals interested in investing in the stock market and for professionals in the finance industry.

To replicate this project, download the dataset from Kaggle, and run the experiments presented in the Google Colab notebooks. The results and discussions of the experiments are presented in the PDF document, which should be consulted for a detailed analysis of the findings.
